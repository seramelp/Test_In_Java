# Test_In_java


#A Maven Project that  includes (at least) the following components:

1. A class named StatisticUtilsArray. This class is responsible for providing a set of statistical values for an array of double values. More specifically, the statistical metrics  are the following:
a. Minimum Value
b. Maximum Value
c. Median Value
d. Mean Value
e. Standard Deviation

2. A class named StatisticUtilsArrayList. This class provides the aforementioned metrics, but for an arraylist of double values.

3. A class named AscendingMinima. This class implements the Ascending Minima Algorithm using the most efficient data structures.

4. Two classes named  StatisticUtilsArrayStream and StatisticUtilsArrayListStream which utilize Java Streams for the estimation of the statistic metrics needed.

5. A class named StatisticUtilsTemplates which can handle all Numerical data types, by using Templates.
